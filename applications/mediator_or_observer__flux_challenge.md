## Mediator

Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

## Observer

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Could I combine these?  
   A mediator object that has a one-to-one (not many relationship with my Observer?).
